## Description
Developers are likely to be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
To help developers become familiar with these tests, this timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions was created. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.
